/**
 * Blocks a short, explicit list of well-known third-party ad/tracker hosts the Alloha player page
 * pulls in for its own ad breaks - fail-open by design: anything not on [AD_HOST_BLOCKLIST] is
 * left completely alone. Alloha's own domain and its CDN hosts are never in this list and must
 * never be added to it - blocking the player's own requests (rather than third-party ad ones) has
 * broken session extraction before, see AllohaWrapperScript's comment on the master.m3u8 capture.
 * This is a defense-in-depth measure alongside the media-mute logic in [wrapperHtml] - it reduces
 * how often an ad loads at all, it doesn't replace muting whatever does get through.

/**

 * and recreating the WebView from scratch) pays that cost every time. The reference
 * implementation avoids this by keeping one WebView alive for the whole activity lifetime.
 * We use a small pool (capped at [MAX_IDLE_WEB_VIEWS]) instead of a single shared instance so a
 * second concurrent caller (e.g. a background download running while an episode is playing)
 * can't collide with an in-use WebView - it simply gets its own fresh instance, which it
 * destroys again on release instead of returning it to an already-full pool.
